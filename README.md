## 🕹️ About the Game

*Pong in Python* is a recreation of one of the most iconic games of all time — a classic 1v1 paddle battle brought to life using **Pygame**.

This wasn't just another project. It was a moment of realization.  
September 2023 marked a shift: I wasn’t just building games to learn anymore — I was learning to build them better.

This version of Pong represents one of my earliest attempts at structuring gameplay systems with more precision, adding polish, and thinking about the *feel* of a game, not just its functionality.

## ▶️ How to Run the Game

1. **Install Pygame** (if not already installed):
   ```bash
   pip install pygame
   ```

2. **Download or clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Mughal-Hash-24/Pong
   cd Pong
   ```

3. **Make sure all required assets (if any) are in the same directory as `main.py`.**

4. **Run the game:**
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

Controls:
- **Player 1:** W (up), S (down)  
- **Player 2:** Up Arrow (↑), Down Arrow (↓)

## 🧠 What I Learned

- Building a real-time, two-player game loop  
- Implementing reliable collision detection between fast-moving objects  
- Controlling ball direction and speed post-collision  
- Handling keypresses for two players simultaneously  
- Fine-tuning motion using frame-based timing and delta velocity  
- The importance of game *feel* and pacing

## 🎯 Reflections

Looking back, Pong was more than just a remake. It was a chance to revisit the foundations of game design — simplicity, clarity, and precision.

No flashy graphics. No complex physics. Just paddles, a ball, and the thrill of keeping it all in sync.

This project helped me think beyond just "making things work" — and more about *making things feel good*.  
It’s not the most complex game I’ve made. But it’s one of the most honest.
